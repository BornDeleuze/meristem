  <i>The actively dividing and multiplying cells that differentiate to form all parts of a plant. Found in the root tips, branch tips and lateral growth areas, the meristem is where the magic of plant growth happens. It’s the starting point for the life of a tree, and thus the starting point for the furniture I build.</i>

    Meristem Woodworks is the home for the furniture and interior carpentry work of Philip Shelton. <br/>
    I characterize my furniture design style as wood-forward; showcasing the wood for what it is, without diminishing or masking it. <br/>
    The wood itself is the centerpiece and the aesthetic of my work.

  Wood is a living medium, and the furniture maker an artist who works that life into new forms. <br/>
  Furniture making is not a static activity, with dead inputs and stagnant outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
  In crafting new forms of being from living mediums, I strive to imbue each piece with the honor and respect that the trees deserve as they’re morphed into becoming part of our daily lives in our built spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
  After all, furniture is but one possibility in the lifespan of a tree.
