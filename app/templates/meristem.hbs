  <p><i>The actively dividing and multiplying cells that differentiate to form all parts of a plant. Found in the root tips, branch tips and lateral growth areas, the meristem is where the magic of plant growth happens. It’s the starting point for the life of a tree, and thus the starting point for the furniture I build.</i></p>

    <p>
      Meristem Woodworks is the home for the furniture and interior carpentry work of Philip Shelton.
    </p>  
    <p>
      I characterize my furniture design style as wood-forward; showcasing the wood for what it is, without diminishing or masking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wood itself is the centerpiece and the aesthetic of my work.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Wood is a living medium, and the furniture maker an artist who works that life into new forms.
      Furniture making is not a static activity, with dead inputs and stagnant outcomes. In crafting new forms of being from living mediums, I strive to imbue each piece with the honor and respect that the trees deserve as they’re morphed into becoming part of our daily lives in our built spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, furniture is but one possibility in the lifespan of a tree.
