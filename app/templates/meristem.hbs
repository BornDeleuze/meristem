About Meristem Woodworks:



Meristem- the actively dividing and multiplying cells that differentiate to form all parts of a plant. Found in the root tips, branch tips and lateral growth areas, the meristem is where the magic of plant growth happens. It’s the starting point for the life of a tree, and thus the starting point for the furniture I build.



Meristem Woodworks is the home for the furniture and interior carpentry work of Philip Shelton. I characterize my furniture design style as wood-forward; showcasing the wood for what it is, without diminishing or masking it. The wood itself is the centerpiece and the aesthetic of my work.  



Wood is a living medium, and the furniture maker an artist who works that life into new forms. Furniture making is not a static activity, with dead inputs and stagnant outcomes. In crafting new forms of being from living mediums, I strive to imbue each piece with the honor and respect that the trees deserve as they’re morphed into becoming part of our daily lives in our built spaces. After all, furniture is but one possibility in the lifespan of a tree.
